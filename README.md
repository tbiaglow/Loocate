“Where to go when you’ve got to go in NYC”

A full-stack app created by Allen, Giselle and Thomas.

Loocate uses public data from the Park Inspection Program - Inventory at NYC Open Data project, which contains a wealth of information on the public restrooms (“comfort stations”) contained in NYC parks, including seasonal inspections that rate the restrooms cleanliness and how busy they were. Loocate stores this data in its backend database, which is parsed, formatted, and returned to the user based on their search query.

To use this app, simply type your zip code into the "Search Zip Code" box and press the search button. Underneath the search bar is another button called "Search My Location", which grabs your zip code from your IP address and searches your location. You can also filter your search using any of the filter tickboxes.

Your search results will display all nearby bathrooms, with their exact address, the number of toilets, urinals, and changing tables, an option to rate the location, and recent inspection results.
