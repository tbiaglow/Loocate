# Loocate

“Where to go when you’ve got to go in NYC”

A full-stack app created by Allen, Giselle and Thomas.

Loocate uses public data from the Park Inspection Program - Inventory at NYC Open Data project, which contains a wealth of information on the public restrooms (“comfort stations”) contained in NYC parks, including seasonal inspections that rate the restrooms cleanliness and how busy they were. Loocate stores this data in its backend database, which is parsed, formatted, and returned to the user based on their search query.
